# GNU Make

GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

This project provides python wheels for GNU Make. GNU make doesn't have builtin
support for cross compilation on macOS and Windows like xmake. So the wheels for
macOS on amd64 and Windows for arm64 are missing.

See [xmake-python](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-python#autotoolsmakefile).
